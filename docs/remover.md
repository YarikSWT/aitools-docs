## What is Background Remover for?

Icons8 Background Remover is a tool that automatically removes background from your images using AI. For example, Upscaler will be helpful when you want to:
* Create clean showcase photos of your product for your online store.
* Add a basic background to a photo of yours to make it more professional.
* Separate a text from its background.

## Uploading

To upload a picture to Background Remover you can either pick one through your system's file explorer or drag and drop it onto the uploading area.

BGRemover also supports batch uploads through multiple selection. On Windows you can do that in several ways:
* Select files using selection box while holding down left mouse button.
* Hold down <img align="center" height="50" src="/public/ctrlbut.png"> and click on each item you want to upload.
* Click on the first file, hold down <img align="center" height="60" src="/public/shiftbut.png"> and click on the last one, then release the button.

BGRemover also supports uploading images from clipboard, to do that just press <img align="center" height="50" src="/public/ctrlbut.png"> **+** <img align="center" height="47" src="/public/vkey.png"> while Upscaler is open.

:information_source: Please keep in mind the file requirements: our tool accepts **.png** and **.jpg** up to **5 Mb** in filesize.

## Actions

After an image has been uploaded to the Background Remover, you will see several controls for each image.

* <img align="center" height="50" src="/public/corrbut.png"> enables retouching mode, allowing you to erase areas the Remover missed or restore parts it mistakenly deleted.
* <img align="center" height="50" src="/public/helpbut.png"> is a paid option which lets you get professionally retouched images for cases where an AI didn't achieve desirable results.
* <img align="center" height="50" src="/public/upscalebut.png"> will upload the image to [AI Smart Upscaler](https://icons8.com/upscaler)
* <img align="center" height="50" src="/public/facebut.png"> will upload the image to [AI Face Swapper](https://icons8.com/swapper)

Controls for batch uploads are virtually the same, these optional are available if you click on individual images within the batch.

## Privacy

What you upload, obviously, can't be seen by others, but for troubleshooting purposes we may ask your permission to access your uploads. You have the right to decline our request, but then we wouldn't be able to help you in case you face any issues while using Upscaler.

You can delete images uploaded to Smart Upscler right inside the tool, but you will be able to access them with a direct link for the next 60 days. After two months pass, the images get deleted permanently.

## FAQ and common cases

**Q:** Background remover didn't remove some parts of the image or removed too much. <br>
**A:** No algorithm is perfect. You can erase extra parts and restore missing ones by using correction tool or request professional retouching from us.

**Q:** I have uploaded images, but they've been stuck in the queue for several minutes. <br>
**A:** Processing heavily depends on the number of images, their initial size and resolution as well as server load. We recommend waiting, but if you believe they truly got lost, please contact our support.

**Q:** Is there a limit for batch uploads? <br>
**A:** No, but one should keep in mind format and size limitations Background Remover has and also the fact, that the more images you upload, the bigger the performance hit will be. For really large uploads please consider getting an API subscription.

**Q:** I bought a prepaid pack, but didn't receive my order. <br>
**A:** If you didn't have an Icons8 account while buying the pack, the system will automatically create one with the billing email used during checkout and offer you to set up a password. If you missed that window, then you will have to request password change for the account. If you are sure you did everything correctly, please contact our support team.
