## What is Smart Upscaler for?

AI Smart Upscaler is a next-gen tool aimed at improving any kind of images you might have. With it you can better preserve your family's memories by processing archive photos; make the most out of the blurry pictures you snapped in haste; or make a cool, but low-res wallpaper you found on the Internet fit any screen you have. You name it.

## Uploading
Uploading images to Smart Upscaler is easy. Just keep in mind the file requirements: our tool accepts **.png** and **.jpg** up to **5 Mb** in filesize.

To upload a picture, you can either pick one through your system's file explorer or drag and drop it onto the uploading area.
Upscaler also supports batch uploads through multiple selection. On Windows 10 you can do that in several ways:
* Hold down <img align="center" height="50" src="/public/ctrlbut.png"> and click on each item you want to upload.
* Select files using selection box while holding down <img align="center" height="40" src="/public/leftclick.png">
* Click on the first file, hold down <img align="center" height="60" src="/public/shiftbut.png"> and click on the last one, then release the button.

Smart Upscaler also supports uploading images from clipboard, to do that just press <img align="center" height="50" src="/public/ctrlbut.png"> **+** <img align="center" height="47" src="/public/vkey.png"> while Upscaler is open.

## Privacy

What our users upload, obviously, can't be seen by others, but for troubleshooting purposes we may ask your permission to access your uploads. You have the right to decline our request, but then we unfortunately wouldn't be able to help you in case you face any issues while using Upscaler.

Images uploaded to Smart Upscaler can be deleted by you right inside the tool, but they will be able to be accessed with a direct link for the next 60 days. After two months pass, the images get deleted permanently.
