## What is Face Swapper for?

Icons8 Face Swapper is a tool that lets you both combine and swap faces and bodies on photos using artificial intelligence. For example, you can use it for following purposes:
* face swapping just for fun;
* making your online identity less recognizable by combining your photos with generated appearances;

## Uploading

To upload a picture to Face Swapper you can either pick one through your system's file explorer or drag and drop it onto the uploading area.

## FAQ and common cases

**Q:** Background remover didn't remove some parts of the image or removed too much. <br>
**A:** You can erase extra parts and restore missing ones by using correction tool or request professional retouching from us.

**Q:** I have uploaded images, but they've been stuck in the queue for several minutes. <br>
**A:** We recommend waiting, but if you believe your images got lost in the queue, please contact our support.

**Q:** Is there a limit for batch uploads? <br>
**A:** There are no limits for batch uploads, but you should keep in mind that the more images you upload, the bigger the performance hit will be. For really large uploads, please consider getting an API subscription.

**Q:** I bought a prepaid pack, but didn't receive my order. <br>
**A:** If you didn't have an Icons8 account while buying the pack, the system will automatically create one with the billing email used during checkout and offer you to set up a password. If you missed that window, you will have to request a password change for the account. If you still need help with your order, please contact our support team.
